# awesome-booksES6

In this project, I will restructure my Awesome books app code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules. I will also practice the ES6 syntax that I have learned.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Boilerplate for HTML
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

In this project, we will build a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. We will achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. We will also need to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events this project is develop to Microverse curriculum.
